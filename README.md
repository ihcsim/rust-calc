# rust-calc

A rust calculator that can perform a bunch of arithmetic operations.

I wrote this program as part of my learning of important conceptslike:

* [ownership](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html)
* [structs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-00-structs.html)
* [enums](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-00-enums.html)
* [iterator](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch13-02-iterators.html)
* [closures](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch13-01-closures.html)
* [casting](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/conversion.html)
* [unit tests](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-00-testing.html)

To run the program:

```sh
cargo run
```

To run the unit tests:

```sh
cargo test
```
